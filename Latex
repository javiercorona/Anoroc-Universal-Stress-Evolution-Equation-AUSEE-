\begin{abstract}
Understanding the dynamic evolution and internal rebalancing of celestial bodies under gravitational and rotational stresses is fundamental to planetary science. Here, we introduce the Anoroc Framework, presenting a universal mathematical relation unifying rotational torque, tidal exchange, and internal energy redistribution across all planetary bodies. A central innovation, the Geometric Correction Factor $C_{geom} = f(\Theta, \rho(r), R, \Omega, e)$, generalizes the framework to diverse planetary geometries and enables cross-planetary comparison. The resulting dimensionless Master Equation is scalable from Earth to exoplanetary systems, supporting predictive modeling of stress evolution and rotational stability.

\section{Introduction}
Planetary bodies undergo continuous adjustment of their internal stress and spin states due to gravitational interactions, tidal effects, and intrinsic processes. Existing models often analyze these facets in isolation or rely on planet-specific calibrations. The Anoroc Framework posits a dimensionally scalable law, integrating rotational mechanics, tidal physics, and geodynamic dissipation to unify these phenomena for any celestial body.

\section{Theoretical Framework: The Anoroc Master Equation}
\subsection{Core Components and Physical Principles}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Gravitational Tidal Torque} ($\tau_G$): External torque from gravitational influence of stars or moons.
    \item \textbf{Angular Momentum} ($M_A$): Total angular momentum of the system.
    \item \textbf{Rate of Change of Moment of Inertia} ($\dot{I}$): Internal mass redistribution via mantle convection, core movement, or crustal changes.
    \item \textbf{Internal Dissipation and Rebalancing} ($\delta_I$): Internal damping, tidal dissipation, viscous heating, and other equilibrium drivers.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Geometric Correction Factor}
Define the geometry-driven parameter:
\begin{equation}
C_{geom} = f(\Theta, \rho(r), R, \Omega, e)
\end{equation}
where\\
$\Theta$: axial tilt\\
$\rho(r)$: radial density distribution\\
$R$: mean planetary radius\\
$\Omega$: angular velocity\\
$e$: orbital eccentricity\\
This parameter enables the universal law to scale with physical properties of any planet or moon, encoding geometric and mass anisotropies.

\subsection{The Anoroc Master Equation}
Normalized stress function:
\begin{equation}
S^*(t) = \frac{S(t)}{\rho R^2 \Omega^2}
\end{equation}
Core differential law:
\begin{equation}
\frac{dS^*}{dt} = C_{geom} \left( \frac{\tau_G}{M_A \Omega^2 R^3} - \frac{\dot{I}}{I} - \delta_I \right)
\end{equation}

\subsection{Cross-Planetary Scaling and Universality}
To compare the stress evolution of different planets in a normalized way:
\begin{equation}
\frac{S_{planet}}{S_{Earth}} = 
\frac{(1 - C_{geom,planet}) \cdot \tau_{G,planet} \cdot M_{A,planet}}
     {(1 - C_{geom,Earth}) \cdot \tau_{G,Earth} \cdot M_{A,Earth}}
+ \frac{\dot{I}_{planet}}{\dot{I}_{Earth}}
\end{equation}
This expression allows Earth-derived calibration to be applied to other bodies such as Mars or Titan, for direct comparative modeling and universality.

\section{Applications and Predictive Power}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Forecasting rotational stability, tidal synchronization, and realignment timescales.
    \item Predictive modeling of tectonic precursor stress migration and internal rebalancing in exoplanetary systems.
    \item Simulation of engineered spin control or tidal energy harvesting approaches in astroengineering.
\end{itemize}

\section{Discussion}
The Anoroc Framework's universal, normalized structure enables robust planetary modeling and comparison. Its dependence on geometric correction embeds flexibility for arbitrary internal structures and orbital configurations. Extensions may include testing against observational data, calibration to solar system and exoplanet targets, and simulation for planetary design.

\section{Conclusion}
The Anoroc Master Equation provides a comprehensive, dimensionally scalable law for planetary stress evolution, bridging rotational mechanics, tidal dynamics, and internal dissipation for both scientific and astroengineering applications.
